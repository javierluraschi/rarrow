# arrow

The goal of arrow is to have R bindings to [apache
arrow](https://arrow.apache.org). This is just a proof of concept right now.

# Installation

## Arrow

First install a release build of the C++ bindings to arrow.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow.git
cd arrow/cpp && mkdir release && cd release

# It is important to statically link to boost libraries
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DARROW_BOOST_USE_SHARED:BOOL=Off
make install
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(arrow)
# Default print method calls the ToString method on the arrow array
arrow_array(1:5)

arrow_array(5:10)


# to_r converts the arrow array to an R vector
x <- arrow_array(1:25)
to_r(x)
```
