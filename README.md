arrow
=====

The goal of arrow is to have R bindings to [apache arrow](https://arrow.apache.org). This is just a proof of concept right now.

Installation
============

Arrow
-----

First install a release build of the C++ bindings to arrow.

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow.git
cd arrow/cpp && mkdir release && cd release

# It is important to statically link to boost libraries
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DARROW_BOOST_USE_SHARED:BOOL=Off
make install
```

Example
-------

``` r
library(arrow)
# Default print method calls the ToString method on the arrow array
arrow_array(1:5)
#> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

arrow_array(5:10)
#> [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]


# to_r converts the arrow array to an R vector
x <- arrow_array(1:25)
to_r(x)
#>  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
#> [24] 24 25
```
